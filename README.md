# iris-prediction-model
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify flowers in the Iris dataset into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model achieves high accuracy (â‰ˆ100% with random_state=42), making it reliable for classification tasks on the Iris dataset.

Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression

This project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify the famous Iris dataset
 into three species:

*Setosa

*Versicolor

*Virginica

It demonstrates a full machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
